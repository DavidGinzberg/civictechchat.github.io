**Civic Tech Chat** is a monthly podcast covering the civic technology movement. Inspired by FDR's [Fireside Chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats), we seek to raise awareness of the work being done by technologists around the world to build a public service infrastructure that works more efficiently and conveniently for all citizens.

**ci‚Ä¢vic  tech‚Ä¢no‚Ä¢lo‚Ä¢gy** *(n.)*: technology (mainly information technology) that enables engagement or participation of the public for stronger development, enhancing citizen communications, improving government infrastructure, and generally improving the public good.
